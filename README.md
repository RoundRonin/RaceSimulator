# RaceSimulator

## Instruments
Visual Studio 2022
Git

## How to use
1. Build the project
2. Run the program
3. Follow CLI instructions

## Structure
Program uses CLI as a UI

What is implemented:
1. Transport hierarchy (abstractions and implementations)
2. RaceLogic hierarchy (interfaces and implementations) to provide specificity on what types of transport are allowed to participate
3. CLI instuments (interfaces and implementations)
4. Weather classes that follow State design pattern (interfaces and implementations)
5. Utility classes and simple factories to assist with SOLID implementation
